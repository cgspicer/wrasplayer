# Simple Album 88 Player

Built for Georgia State University's one and only WRAS Atlanta 88.5, Album 88, with love. Left on the dial. *Right* on the music.

Beginning in June 2014, WRAS 88.5 will air GPB content from 5a.m. to 7p.m.. Since this app uses the internet stream, it's a great way to tune into regular programming, uninterrupted.

For more information about Album 88, visit their website at [http://www2.gsu.edu/~www885/](http://www2.gsu.edu/~www885/).

A simple HTML 5 app that takes the feed's playlist, loads the audio file and allows the user to play, pause, and refresh the stream. Built with the Ionic framework for iOS and Android, with slight modifications to enable background playing.
